# Excel-Dashboard

✨ I am excited to share my latest Sales Dashboard! ✨
I’ve been improving my data visualization skills, and I’m proud to have created this interactive dashboard in Excel. It covers sales performance across various categories, customer insights, and trends over time. 📊
From tracking monthly sales to analyzing top customers and profit trends, this dashboard combines everything in a user-friendly format. I used tools like pivot tables, charts, and slicers to make data exploration easier and more intuitive.
🔍 Key Features:
Sales by Category to highlight the highest-selling products.
Profit Gained Over Time with detailed trends across furniture, office supplies, and technology.
Customer Insights including top 5 customers and yearly count.
Geographical Sales broken down by state.
Looking forward to hearing your feedback and continuing to develop my skills in data analysis and visualization!
